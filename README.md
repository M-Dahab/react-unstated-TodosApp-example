# react-unstated-TodosApp-example
This is a simple example of using [unstated](https://unstated.io/) to manage the state of a simple todo list app using [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/what-is-tailwind) for styling based on the great work at [this](https://github.com/goandbuild/cra-postcss-tailwind) repo.

*Note: this is not production ready and needs improvements, you might run into problems in your styles - in the production build - because of purgecss.
